Module "LED"       (component BitIO)
   - LED_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - LED_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - LED_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - LED_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - LED_NegVal -Negates (inverts) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(!GetVal())]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "MyClock"   (component TimerInt)

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

Module "MyUART"    (component AsynchroSerial)
   - MyUART_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - MyUART_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the 
                output buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.
   - MyUART_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - MyUART_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

Module "MPL115A2"  (component InternalI2C)
   - MPL115A2_SendChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes one character (byte) to the bus. The 
                slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" method or in the component 
                initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is enabled and the method 
                returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The state of transmission is obtainable from 
                (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost) events.   When working as a SLAVE, this method writes a character to 
                the internal output slave buffer and, after the master starts the communication, to the I2C bus. If no 
                character is ready for a transmission (internal output slave buffer is empty), the Empty character will be sent 
                (see "Empty character" property).
   - MPL115A2_RecvChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus, then reads one character (byte) from the bus and then 
                sends the stop condition. The slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" 
                method or in component initialization section, property "Target slave address init". If interrupt service is 
                enabled and the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was finished successfully. The state 
                of transmission must be tested by means of events (OnReceiveData, OnError or OnArbitLost). In case of 
                successful transmission, received data is ready after OnReceiveData event is called.   When working as a SLAVE, 
                this method reads a character from the input slave buffer.
   - MPL115A2_SendBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the bus. The 
                slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SlaveSelect10" method or in component 
                initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is enabled and the method 
                returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The state of transmission is detectable by 
                means of events (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost). Data to be send is not copied to an internal buffer 
                and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of the buffer should not be changed until the 
                transmission is complete. Event OnTransmitData can be used to detect the end of the transmission.  When working 
                as a SLAVE, this method writes a block of characters to the internal output slave buffer and then, after the 
                master starts the communication, to the I2C bus. If no character is ready for a transmission (internal output 
                slave buffer is empty), the "Empty character" will be sent (see "Empty character" property). In SLAVE mode the 
                data are copied to an internal buffer, if specified by "Output buffer size" property.
   - MPL115A2_RecvBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus, then reads the block of characters from the bus and then 
                sends the stop condition. The slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" 
                method or in component initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is 
                enabled and the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was finished successfully. The state 
                of transmission must be tested by means of events (OnReceiveData, OnError or OnArbitLost). In case of 
                successful transmission, received data is ready after OnReceiveData event is called.   When working as a SLAVE, 
                this method reads a block of characters from the input slave buffer.
   - MPL115A2_SendStop -If the "Automatic stop condition" property value is 'no', this method sends a valid stop condition to 
                the serial data line of the I2C bus to terminate the communication on the bus after using send methods. This 
                method is enabled only if "Automatic stop condition" property is set to 'no'.
   - MPL115A2_SelectSlave -This method selects a new slave for communication by its 7-bit slave address value. Any send or 
                receive method directs to or from selected device, until a new slave device is selected by this method. This 
                method is not available for the SLAVE mode.

   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.

   - WAIT2_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT2_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.
